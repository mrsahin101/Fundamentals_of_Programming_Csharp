# CHAPTER 8 -> NUMERAL SYSTEMS

- Duodecimal : Base-12 numeral system
- Sexagesimal : Base-60 numeral system

- Every numeral system has **base**. Any number can be chosen as base, but it absolute value has to be different than 1 and 0. It can be real or complex number too.

- Mathematically it is proven that best way to represent number ( length and number of digit used for depiction) is by using Euler number ( e = 2.71828...)

- But working with base e is inconvenient and impractical. So because of that working with base 2 or 3 is most optimal way. Since it is easier to implement base 2 on computers we use base 2.

- Positional Numeral systems are basically the value of digit is decided by its position in the representation! They are used almost in every systems today.

- There is also Non-Positional Numeral Systems, which is numbers are represented by their size not place. Which is huge drawback when it comes to represent big numbers! This numbers systems are rarely used!
