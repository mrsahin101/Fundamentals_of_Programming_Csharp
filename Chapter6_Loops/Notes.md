# Chapter 5-> LOOPS

- While Loop Syntax :
    while(condition)    // condition has to be boolean
    {
        loop body;
    }


- Break keyword when reached its breaking the loop instantly.

- DO-While Loop Syntax : (this also knows post-test loop)
    do
    {
        executable code;
    }while(condition);

- If you want to work with really big numbers you can work with BigInteger and its very large. (it could be using 100000 digits.) as long as you have enough memory big integers are good
